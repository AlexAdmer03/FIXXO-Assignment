# FIXXO-Assignment
In this individual project, the task is to build two pages for an e-commerce website called Fixxo. The project provides a design file in XD format, which can be opened with Adobe XD or Sketch. The goal is to implement the design of the Home and Contacts pages, making necessary design decisions due to deviations from standard web design practices. The website can be built using static HTML files or technologies like React. To pass the project, all components on the Home and Contacts pages need to be implemented with a good code structure, utilizing flexbox and CSS grid where appropriate. Buttons and links should have animations or transitions. To achieve a higher grade, SCSS should be used for structuring CSS, the contact form should be validated using JavaScript with appropriate error messages, and the form data should be submitted to a provided web API, displaying a confirmation message. Additionally, the Home page should display products retrieved from another provided web API.
